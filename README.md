## Task 1: Host a simple webpage on AWS
Design and implement a highly available, low-latency website on AWS using Amazon S3 bucket for hosting and CloudFront for content delivery using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform for reproducibility. The goal of the task is to host an “index” HTML file, guaranteeing high availability, minimizing latency, and enabling auto-scaling for optimal performance.

## Task 3: Vehicle Detection, Tracking and Speed Estimation
According to the World Health Organization, each year approximately 1,19 million people die due to road accidents. Children and young adults aged 5-29 are more likely to die because of road traffic injuries. Speeding is one of the main risk factors for road crashes so predicting high speed is crucial (World Health Organization: WHO, 2023).
